# PATHify: Plant Health Identifier

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify plant diseases into 38 categories. The model is designed to assist in identifying plant diseases based on image data, with the goal of supporting sustainable agriculture and improving crop management practices.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Lite
- NumPy
- os
- cv2
- json
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (optional, for visualizing results)


## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Download and prepare the dataset from the link below
   - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it.
   - Execute the notebook cells to train and evaluate the CNN model.

3. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Check the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, on the validation and test sets.
